 problem statement requires us to find the minimum number of
 operations to reduce a given number to zero if possible. This
 or return -1;
 

we are finding the Maximum length of subarray with 
sum = total - value;
so we have two pointers, and iterate while closing down the window, 
if the values is reached we keep it in a variable, 
later we return the value with the minimum length 
The problem is similar to a sliding window problem.
